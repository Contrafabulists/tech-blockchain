<h2>Blockchain On Tech Blogs</h2>
<p>I want to better understand the blockchain stories coming out of major tech blogs, to understand the waves of claims being made, so I am working to pull an index of all stories.</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="techcrunch/">Techcrunch</a></li>
  <li><a href="readwrite/">ReadWrite</a></li>
  <li><a href="venturebeat/">VentureBeat</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I will be adding more to this page when I have it available. Once I have everything indexed I'll started pulling company names, industries, and other relevant information.</p>
